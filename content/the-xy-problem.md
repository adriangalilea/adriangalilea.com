## The Perfect Example

**What they ask**: "How do I make my car horn louder?"

**What they really want**: To avoid hitting deer on rural roads at night

**What happens**: People suggest amplifiers, new horns, wiring modifications...

**The actual solution**: Deer whistles ($10, no wiring, actually works)

This is the XY Problem: asking about your attempted solution (Y) instead of your actual problem (X).

## How It Happens

1. You want to do X
2. You think Y might be a way to do X
3. You don't know how to do Y
4. You ask for help with Y
5. People waste time helping with Y
6. Y doesn't even solve X properly
7. Eventually X is revealed
8. A better solution emerges

## More Examples

**Everyday Life:**
- **Asks**: "What's the strongest ladder?" → **Wants**: To change a high light bulb (bulb changer pole is safer)
- **Asks**: "How to remove a stuck bolt?" → **Wants**: To replace a toilet seat (might need to cut it)
- **Asks**: "Best waterproof glue?" → **Wants**: To fix a leaking pipe (needs replacement, not glue)

**Programming:**
- **Asks**: "How to get last 3 characters of filename?" → **Wants**: File extension (use `${file##*.}`)
- **Asks**: "How to parse HTML with regex?" → **Wants**: Extract links (use a parser)
- **Asks**: "How to run command every second?" → **Wants**: Monitor file changes (use inotify)

## How to Ask Better

**Bad**: "How do I do Y?"

**Good**: "I'm trying to do X. I was thinking Y might work, but I'm stuck. What's the best approach?"

**Best**: "My goal is X. Context: [explain situation]. I've considered Y. What do you recommend?"
