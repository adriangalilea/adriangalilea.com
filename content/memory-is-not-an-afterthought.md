I've seen many proposals for adding memory into agents as MCPs. This highlights a misunderstanding of what memory is and in what layer of the stack it needs to be.

Memory is something that has to inform thinking direction.

Memory is not active as much as it is passive.

Memories have to be passively triggered, not actively searched, for the most part.
