// THE CARD: every box that holds content, shadcn's Card by its own name and parts, so
// anyone who knows shadcn knows it, in either material: plain, the page's card with its
// hairline; glass, the material's glass, rounder, as glass is. Glass is a face of the
// card, never a family of its own.
//
//   <Card>                                   a region: a settings group, a list
//     <CardHeader>
//       <CardTitle>lore 1.4</CardTitle>
//       <CardDescription>ready to ship</CardDescription>
//       <CardAction><Button …/></CardAction>
//     </CardHeader>
//     <CardContent>…</CardContent>
//     <CardFooter>                           where it is answered, a band
//       <Button variant="secondary">later</Button>
//       <Button>publish</Button>
//     </CardFooter>
//   </Card>
//
// An item, one thing a person reads and acts on (a ticket, a step, a post), is a card
// too: `<Card hue padding="compact" interactive>`, its hue, padding and the hand's
// light being options here. What only an item has (its kind, its author, its counts,
// opening it whole) is `item-card`, an item of its own on this one: those parts need
// an avatar, a dialog and a button, which no region should install. swift-utils' Ink
// draws the two as `InkPanel` and `inkCard`.
//
// THE FLARE RULE (tokens.css, material-glass `FLARE_LIGHT` and `FLARE_INK`): a card
// that carries a hue (`hue`) wears that ONE hue, alpha the only variable. Glass: the
// hue stains the glass (6%) and its rim catches it; the marks inside (its kind, a count
// that is yours) in the hue made readable on the face. Plain: the page's card and its
// hairline, never a tinted fill or a coloured edge; the hue only in the marks. An
// `interactive` card (one a person points at and acts on) catches more light under the
// hand and nothing moves (a container never moves): glass a step more stain and rim,
// plain a step brighter. `lifted` holds that light without the hand (a card carried).
//
// Its FRONT SURFACES, for a card that scrolls or pins: a `head` across its top and a
// `foot` along its bottom, strips of the card itself, not pieces laid on it (a tab
// list, a board's column names, a card's buttons). In glass each is the material's
// front (`glassFront`): its own blur over what passes under it, one lit hairline as its
// inner edge, the card's edge unbroken over both. Plain, a solid strip a step darker
// than the card. A head is `headHeight` tall (3rem), a foot `footHeight`, told to what
// it holds as `--card-head` and `--card-foot`; what pins under the head (a table's
// header row) pins at `--card-under`. They are props, not children, because they are
// laid beside the scroller, never inside it.
//
//   <Card material="glass" head={<TabsList>…</TabsList>} maxHeight="30rem">…</Card>
//
// It SCROLLS when it is given a height: `maxHeight` (it grows to the cap, then
// scrolls) or `height` (it keeps it whatever it holds; what fills it, a log, scrolls
// itself). Its body is then the one capped scroller (`ScrollArea`), the head and the
// foot laid OVER it, so what scrolls passes beneath them and comes out from under them:
// in glass blurred by them, plain hidden by them. Never a front inside the scroller:
// a plain scroller's fade is a mask, which makes it a backdrop root, and a glass front
// inside it would blur nothing. Long ones wear thumbs (`thumb`, on).
// Growing with what it holds, its head can PIN to the page while the body scrolls
// under it (`pin`, a CSS length: below a site header). Plain, its frame is then drawn
// by the head and the body, so the head pinned mid-card is still the card's rounded
// top. `glide` eases the body to a new height (a tab of another length) instead of
// jumping.
//
// `title`, `description`, `action` and `footer` are the same parts given as props, for
// the one-line card: `<Card title="tasks" action={…} footer={…}>`. They draw
// CardHeader and CardFooter, one drawing.
//
// Glass is built of the material's parts, bottom to top: a back layer (the body: its
// blur, its fill, the shadow it casts), what it holds, the spill (`GlassSpill`: what
// nears the edge spills its light round it, on unless `spill={false}`), the front
// surfaces, the edge (`GlassEdge`). The root never blurs: a backdrop blur inside
// another sees only what is between the two, so a front inside a blurring root
// blurred nothing passing under it. What it holds stands on glass (`--glass-body`):
// a control inside takes its plain face unless chosen otherwise (no glass on glass).
//
// A frame is drawn once. What draws a box of its own when it stands alone (a log, a
// trace) asks `useInFrame()` and draws none inside one: a card, or anything that says
// so with `<InFrame>`. A box inside a box was two edges, two corners and two grounds a
// few pixels apart; the default makes that impossible to write by accident, and the
// item's own `frame` prop still decides when given. A card inside another frame draws
// the inset face, a step off what it stands on.
