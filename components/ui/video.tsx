// The one video element. Every `<video>` the registry draws is this one, so the three
// questions every video answers are answered once:
//
//   WHEN IT PLAYS: `play`.
//     "manual"  the person decides (the browser's bar with `controls`, or a player
//               around it). The default.
//     "hover"   while the pointer or focus is on it (or on `interactionRef`, the card
//               it belongs to); on touch, while it is on screen.
//     "visible" while it is on screen.
//     "once"    on arriving on screen, then again only on a fresh hover or focus.
//     "follow"  the page decides: `playing` says whether, and `at` (ms), when given,
//               the instant it must show (a stage whose clock moves the video). It is
//               held unseen until it shows that instant, the poster standing in.
//     Automatic plays ("hover", "visible", "once") wait out reduced motion and a
//     hidden tab, load ahead before they are seen, and a pause from `pauseButton`
//     survives them. The sound of every video the person did not start (automatic or
//     followed) is one decision for the page: they start muted, and unmuting one (its
//     `controls`) turns the sound on for all of them; with sound on, one pauses when
//     the window loses focus.
//   WHAT STANDS IN BEFORE ITS FIRST FRAME: the poster, at the frame's aspect when
//     `width` and `height` are given (the space is reserved), the video fading in once
//     frames arrive. Without them the frame fills a parent the caller sizes.
//   WHAT IT SHOWS WHEN IT STOPS: `rest`. "hold" stays on the frame it reached; "poster"
//     goes back to the start and the poster.
//
// And what every video owes the page: one plays with sound at a time (a second one
// starting with sound pauses the first), and it releases its media when it leaves
// (pause, drop the source, reload empty), because a detached element that was
// playing keeps its sound by the spec's own rule. The source is set by an effect, not
// by the attribute, so a remount (React's dev double mount) puts back what the
// release took.
