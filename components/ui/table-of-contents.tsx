// TABLE OF CONTENTS: which part of a page is being read, and a page's headings as links
// with that one lit, as docs' "on this page" does. Two pieces, because the deciding is
// the same everywhere and the look is not: `useReading(ids)` says which part is being
// read, and `TableOfContents` draws it, as a list beside docs (`look="list"`) or as a
// few words in a landing's margin (`look="words"`). Where it stands (a sticky column,
// the margin's middle) is the page's layout, never the item's.
//
//   <TableOfContents headings={prepared.headings} />                 from markdown-prepare
//   <TableOfContents headings={[{ id: "terms", text: "Terms" }]} />   a page's own parts
//
// THE PART BEING READ is the last whose top has passed the reading line, a share of the
// window's height from its top (`line`), as the eye reads a page: a heading just gone
// under a top bar is still the one being read. At the page's foot the last part is
// being read whatever the line says, so a short last part is ever lit. Read on every
// scroll of the page or of any box in it, once a frame. A part it is given that the
// page lacks screams: the table and the page are one list.
