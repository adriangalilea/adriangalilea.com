// A NEXT LINK THAT PREFETCHES WHAT THE READER REACHES FOR, never what merely scrolls
// past. Next's own <Link>, so navigation, `replace`, `scroll` and the rest are Next's,
// with one difference: Next prefetches a static route IN FULL as each link enters the
// viewport, and on a site of static pages that is most of them, fetched by one reader
// scrolling one page (ui.adriangalilea.com's home fetched 96 item pages, 26 MB, 16
// times the page itself; adriangalilea.com's header made every page fetch the home's
// feed, 294 KB). Each of those is a read of the deployment's prerender store, which
// Vercel bills as ISR reads and Fast Origin Transfer. Here the pointer resting on the
// link, the keyboard reaching it, or a finger landing on it starts the prefetch, a
// beat before the click, so the page is there when it lands.
//
// Next only: it is next/link's own prefetch the reader's intent hands over. Make it
// every internal link of a site (a lint rule refusing `next/link` elsewhere keeps it
// so, as biome's `noRestrictedImports` does).
