// WHO A KEY BELONGS TO, page-wide. Every item that answers keys on the page (a player's
// Space and arrows, a gallery's quick look, a list's letters, a lightbox) registers
// here instead of listening on the document itself, and ONE listener hands each press
// to one of them:
//
//   1. Nothing at all when the press belongs to what it landed in (`ownsKeys`, lib/keys):
//      already taken, typed into a field, or a key a widget answers itself (Space on a
//      switch, an arrow in tabs). A shortcut never also does what the focused control
//      just did.
//   2. A modal (an open lightbox) takes every press; nothing behind it hears one.
//   3. Else the instances in order: the one holding focus (the deepest first), the
//      one under the pointer, the one last pressed or focused in, then the rest, newest
//      first. Each says whether the press was its (`onKey` returns true) and the first
//      that takes it ends the press: a gallery and a player on one page never both
//      answer Space. A part IN HAND (focus, pointer or last used) may also answer
//      "idle": the key is its, with nothing to do now (⌘Z with nothing to undo). That
//      ends the press too, untaken, so the key never falls to another part the person
//      is not in. A part reached only as the newest has no such claim.
//   4. Never an instance or a layer whose root is inside an `inert` subtree: inert is
//      the platform saying nothing in there takes interaction (a picture of a control,
//      a page under a modal of its own), and a key is interaction.
//   5. An instance inside `[data-keys="held"]` only while the hand holds it: focus is
//      in it, or it was the last thing pressed or focused in. Never for the pointer
//      resting over it, never page-wide. For a page of live examples (a gallery of
//      cards, each a real player or list): every example works under the hand, and
//      the page's own keys stay the page's.
//
// THE ESCAPE LADDER is the same listener: the layers open now (a window-filling
// player, a full view, a sheet of keys) in the order they opened, and Esc closes the
// innermost one only, and only when nothing inside it took the Esc first (a menu open
// over the full view closes itself, not the view). Base UI's own popups and dialogs
// close themselves and are seen here as roles that own Escape.
//
// It installs itself with its first instance and leaves with its last, so a page with no
// keyboard items carries no listener at all.
//
// It listens on the document, after the page's own handlers, so what stops a press on
// its way up never reaches it: Base UI's dialog popups stop the arrows, Home and End.
// An item answering those inside a Base UI dialog (the lightbox) answers on its own
// element, asking `ownedHere` first, and registers here too (as a modal) so nothing
// behind it hears a key.
