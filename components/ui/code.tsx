// A code block, highlighted on the SERVER. Shiki is the highlighter VS Code uses, so
// the grammars and themes are the ones the reader already knows, and running it at
// build time means the page ships the markup and none of the highlighter: only the
// copy control is client code.
//
// Two themes are baked into one render (`--shiki-light` / `--shiki-dark` on every
// token) and code.css picks with the theme, so switching does not re-highlight and
// cannot flash.
//
// Two parts anyone can use alone: the markup is lib/code-highlight's `codeHtml`, the
// frame is code-frame's `CodeFrame`, which markdown draws its blocks with too, so a
// block in a page of markdown and one written here are the same block.
