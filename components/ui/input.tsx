// A text field that looks like one: a sunken well (a faint fill and a hairline edge),

// wrong. Wrong is the browser's verdict on the field's own constraints (`minLength`,
// `type="email"`, `pattern`, `required`: `:user-invalid`, once the person has typed
// and moved on, so no state and no handler) or the app's (`aria-invalid`, for what
// only it can know: a name taken, a key refused). At the button's heights, so a field and its button sit
// as one row. `Input` alone, or inside `InputGroup` with things before and after it
// (an icon, a unit, a key, a clear button) that stay inside the well.
//
// `material="glass"`: a well of glass, a pill like the glass button beside it, its
// rim catching more light under the hand and more again while you type in it, red
// light on the rim when the value is wrong. The glass is the field's wrapper, never
// the <input>: an input draws no ::before, where the glass's rim lives.
//
// Inside a `Setting` whose value is inherited, the field is empty and its
// placeholder is the value that applies, drawn as a value (a ghost: the well
// dashed, the words a step back), not a hint; emptied, it clears what is set here.
