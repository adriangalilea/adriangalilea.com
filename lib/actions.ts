// ACTIONS: what a part of a page does when a key asks, declared once as data, so the
// keys that answer, the menus and tooltips that teach them, `aria-keyshortcuts` and
// the page's sheet of keys are all read from one place and can never disagree.
// Framework-free; key-router binds a set to the page (`useActions`), ui/key-sheet
// lists every set on the page. The twin of swift-utils' Keymap (ActionSet, ActionSpec).
//
// A BINDING is a verb (`id`), what it is called (`label`), its keys in lib/keys
// notation ("mod+z", "shift+left", a sequence "g g"; several are alternatives), and
// optionally the MODE it answers in. A set lists its modes innermost first (a
// lightbox's sheet over its zoom over its fit; a player studying a paused frame over
// watching): at a press, the innermost active mode that binds the key wins, and a
// binding with no mode answers in every mode, last. One verb may be bound in several
// modes (a player's frame-back on ← while studying, on , whenever frames are known).
//
// DECLARED, CHECKED: `declare` throws at once, naming what is wrong, for a key that is
// not keys, a chord the browser keeps for itself (⌘W ⌘T ⌘N ⌘Q ⌘⇧T ⌘⇧N ⌘⇧W, Ctrl
// elsewhere: no page can take them), a mode the set does not list, and two bindings of
// one key in one mode (a dispatch nobody could predict). A chord the browser answers
// but lets a focused page take (⌘F, ⌘G, ⌘S…) is answered only while its part holds
// the focus, the pointer or was used last, unless the binding says
// `takesBrowserChord`, which the sheet marks.
