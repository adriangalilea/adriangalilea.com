// MARKDOWN AS A TREE, framework-free: the one parse every reader and writer of
// markdown here shares (the renderer, the editor's converter), so a file means the same
// thing wherever it is shown or edited. CommonMark with GitHub's extensions (tables,
// strikethrough, task lists, autolinks, footnotes) and front matter (YAML or TOML,
// kept as its own node, never read as a rule and a heading). The tree is mdast; every
// node keeps its source position, so a reader can always fall back to the exact text.
