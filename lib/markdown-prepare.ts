// MARKDOWN, PREPARED: what a page of markdown needs worked out once, where the files
// are (a build, a script), so the page only draws. `prepareMarkdown` parses the text
// with markdown-core's own syntax and returns the tree `Markdown` draws (`tree`), with
// what a page around it reads: its headings as a table of contents, its words as plain
// text (a description, a preview), its pictures measured. `highlightTree` then colours
// its code blocks as `code` does (the same highlighter and themes, so they are `code`'s
// blocks), and no highlighter loads in the browser.
//
// FACTS COME FROM WHOEVER HOLDS THEM. A picture's size is in its file, and only the
// host knows where its files are: it passes `measure`, which answers a local picture's
// size or null for one that is not its own (another site's), and THROWS for one of its
// own that is missing, the broken post a build should refuse.
//
// LINKS ARE CHECKED the same way. A link to a heading of the text (`#open`) must find
// one, or it throws; every other link goes through the host's `resolve`, which knows
// its files: a file of its own becomes its page, one that is missing throws. So a
// heading renamed, or a file moved, breaks the build, never a reader's click.
// `sectionsOf` cuts a prepared text into a page per heading, each keeping the text's
// anchors.
//
// TAGS ARE DATA. A text that names components (`<Bars unit="s" data={[…]} />`) says
// which with `tags`; a tag not among them throws, and so does a prop that is not a
// literal (a string, a number, true, false, null, an array or an object of them): a
// prop is read here, never run. The props land on the node (`data.props`) as JSON, so
// a prepared tree can be kept on disk and drawn later. With tags, raw HTML and `<url>`
// autolinks are not markdown (as in MDX): a `<` opens a tag.
//
// Every node keeps its source position. Framework-free: no react, no DOM.
