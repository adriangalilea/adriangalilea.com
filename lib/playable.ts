// A PLAYABLE: anything with a clock that plays (swift-utils' WORDS.md: a file, a clip,
// a sequence, a scene, or content an app draws itself), told as the facts a driver
// moves through it by: how long it runs, how it is cut, and (when it is told in
// frames) its rate. The content's own lib makes its playable (macos-session's scene
// clock, terminal-session's session timeline); a driver moves through it (the player
// by the clock, a scroll stage by scroll, a still by one fixed instant); the component
// draws the frame at a progress. One contract, so any content plays in any driver.
// Framework-free.
//
// The words, each with one meaning: an INSTANT is a point in time (ms); a SPAN is a
// stretch `{from, to}` (ms, lib/span); the OUTLINE is how the playable is cut, coarse
// to fine; a LEVEL is one depth of it (chapter, scene, shot); a DIVISION is one item
// of a level, written the concise way, a start and a title, running to the next
// division's start. Chapters are the outline's first level. Nesting is never stored:
// a scene's chapter is the chapter containing its start, so a level that cuts across
// another breaks nothing.
