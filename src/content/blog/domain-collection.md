# emoji domains
I like emoji domains, they standout.
But the UX for writing them is not great. Which is why I like to collect them in groups and progressively enhance them, so you have a memorable name + it's visual identity(logo)
Here are a few examples:
## 👤️ e-id
Idea: Digital identity.

UX: e-id.to/adrian (reads as e-id to adrian)
  - [e-id.to](https://e-id.to)
  - [eid.to](https://eid.to)
  - [👤️️.to](https://👤️️.to)
## 🧊 ice cube
Idea: store information in a block from any blockchain.

Cryogenic preservation for your most valuable data, publicaly verifiable.
  - [🧊️.to](https://🧊️.to)
  - [icecube.to](https://icecube.to)
## ⛓️ chains
(blockchain?)

[⛓️.gg](https://⛓️.gg)

# normal domains
## x-ai.ai
I bought this domain 2 days earlier than Elon anounced his x.ai purchase. I still don't know how to interpret that.
