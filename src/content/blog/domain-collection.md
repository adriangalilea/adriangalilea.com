# emoji domains
I like emoji domains, as they standout from the crowd.
The only problem is usually the UX for writing them is not good, which is why I like to collect them in groups and progressively enhance them, so you have a memorable name + it's visual identity(logo)
Here is a few:
## 👤️ e-id
Idea: Digital identity.
UX: e-id.to/adrian (reads as e-id to adrian)
### domains
  - [e-id.to](https://e-id.to)
  - [eid.to](https://eid.to)
  - [👤️️.to](https://👤️️.to)
## 🧊 ice cube
Idea: store information in a block from any blockchain. Freezing it in time, preserving it for posterity, publicaly verifiable.
### domains
  - [🧊️.to](https://🧊️.to)
  - [icecube.to](https://icecube.to)
## ⛓️ chains
blockchain?
[⛓️.gg](https://⛓️.gg)
